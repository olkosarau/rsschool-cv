## About Me
> Hello!!! \
A little about myself: I have been working as a Python/odoo developer for more than two years. For the first year I worked exclusively on a project using the django (drf) framework (blockchain system), then I switched to the odoo erp project, which is what I’m doing now. Sociable, multitasking, hardy, ready to solve any problems; if I don’t know something, I’ll definitely come to learn and quickly find a solution to this problem).

>I am confident that my professional experience and personal qualities are able to maintain the company's image at the highest level.
